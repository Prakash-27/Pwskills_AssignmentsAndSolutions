          write large: steve jobs cofounded Apple in his parent's garage in
          1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy
          in 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into
          the world's most valuable company. Along the way he helped to
          transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies,
          music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, digital publishing. He
          thus belongs in teh pantheon of America's great innovators, along with
          Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a
          saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will
          remember how they applied imagination to technology and bussiness.
