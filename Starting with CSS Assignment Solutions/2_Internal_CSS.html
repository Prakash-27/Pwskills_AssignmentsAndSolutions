    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
        in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a
        cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages,
            including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.
            CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used with any
            XML-based markup language. Now let's try to break the acronym:</p>
        <li>Cascading: Falling of Styles</li>
        <li> Style: Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags</li>
        <li>Sheets: Writing our style in different documents</li>
    </ul>
