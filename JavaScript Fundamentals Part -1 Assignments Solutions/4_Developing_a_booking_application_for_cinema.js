//4. You are developing a booking application for a cinema. The ticket price depends on the type of the 
// viewer("child", "adult", or "senior"). Write a program which calculates the price accordingly and prints the total 
// price to be paid. Letâ€™s assume the ticket price for a child is Rs. 100, adult ticket price is Rs. 150 and ticket price 
// for a senior is Rs. 120.

let numberOfChilds = 2
let numberOfAdults = 1
let numberOfSeniors = 1

let ticketPrice_Childs = (numberOfChilds * 100)

let ticketPrice_Adults = (numberOfAdults * 150)

let ticketPrice_Seniors = (numberOfSeniors * 120)


let totalTicket_Price = ticketPrice_Childs + ticketPrice_Adults + ticketPrice_Seniors;

console.log("The total ticket price is " + totalTicket_Price);
